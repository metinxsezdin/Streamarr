# Codex Prompt Log

- **Date / Time**: 2025-10-17 15:30 (UTC)
- **Feature / Task**: Sprint 1 library endpoints and CLI
- **Context Summary**:
  - Current state / branch: work
  - Key constraints (deps, performance, security): Maintain SQLite-backed persistence, align responses with draft OpenAPI spec, keep CLI parity with new endpoints.
- **Prompt**:
  ```text
  devam edelim
  ```
- **Assistant Output Summary**:
  - Proposed solution: Add a database-backed library store, expose `/library` list/detail APIs with pagination and search, and extend the manager CLI with matching commands and coverage.
  - Files touched / to create: backend manager API models, stores, routers, schemas, CLI commands/tests, OpenAPI draft, and prompt log entry.
  - Follow-up actions requested: None.
- **Decision**:
  - Accepted â€“ implemented the proposed library API and CLI features for Sprint 1.
- **Validation**:
  - Tests run: `python -m ruff check backend`; `pytest`
  - Manual checks: Confirmed CLI commands print JSON payloads during tests.
- **Notes / Next Steps**:
  - TODOs: Backfill resolver-backed data ingestion and richer filtering once pipelines are wired in.
  - Risks: Library store currently read-only; future writes must keep variant payloads consistent with resolver outputs.
