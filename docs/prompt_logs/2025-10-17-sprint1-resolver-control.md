# Codex Prompt Log

- **Date / Time**: 2025-10-17 16:05 (UTC)
- **Feature / Task**: Sprint 1 – Resolver process controls
- **Context Summary**:
  - Current state / branch: work
  - Key constraints (deps, performance, security): Maintain FastAPI contracts and CLI parity while avoiding flaky subprocess tests.
- **Prompt**:
  ```text

  ```
- **Assistant Output Summary**:
  - Proposed solution: Add resolver start/stop/status endpoints, CLI commands, and tests backed by a managed process helper.
  - Files touched / to create: manager resolver service/router/schema, CLI commands, API/CLI tests, OpenAPI spec, prompt log.
  - Follow-up actions requested: None.
- **Decision**:
  - Accepted – extends resolver management capabilities per roadmap.
- **Validation**:
  - Tests run: `python -m ruff check backend`, `pytest`
  - Manual checks: Reviewed resolver service process management and schema updates.
- **Notes / Next Steps**:
  - TODOs: Future work may include resolver stdout/stderr streaming and configuration overrides.
  - Risks: Subprocess management assumes local resolver context; remote deployments may need pluggable adapters.
