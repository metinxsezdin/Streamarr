# Codex Prompt Log

- **Date / Time**: 2025-10-17 16:10 (UTC)
- **Feature / Task**: Sprint 1 – library metrics endpoint
- **Context Summary**:
  - Current state / branch: work (manager API + CLI scaffolding complete through release year filters)
  - Key constraints (deps, performance, security): maintain SQLite-backed store, expose data for dashboard counts, keep CLI/API parity
- **Prompt**:
  ```text

  ```
- **Assistant Output Summary**:
  - Proposed solution: add a `/library/metrics` API endpoint and CLI command returning aggregate counts for library totals, per-site/type breakdowns, and TMDB coverage
  - Files touched / to create: library store/router, schemas, CLI, API/CLI tests, OpenAPI spec, prompt log
  - Follow-up actions requested: none
- **Decision**:
  - Accepted – metrics endpoint aligns with dashboard requirements and maintains parity between surfaces
- **Validation**:
  - Tests run: `python -m ruff check backend`, `pytest`
  - Manual checks: reviewed dictionary handling for unknown sites/types, ensured route ordering avoids path collisions
- **Notes / Next Steps**:
  - TODOs: surface metrics in future dashboard UI work
  - Risks: ensure future migrations keep counts accurate once queue-based ingestion writes new fields
