# Codex Prompt Log

- **Date / Time**: 2025-10-17 15:30 (UTC)
- **Feature / Task**: Phase 1.5 â€“ Queue observability metrics
- **Context Summary**:
  - Current state / branch: work (Redis-backed queue landed in prior session)
  - Key constraints (deps, performance, security): Maintain Redis/fakeredis compatibility, preserve existing API/CLI contracts, extend observability without breaking tests.
- **Prompt**:
  ```text

  ```
- **Assistant Output Summary**:
  - Proposed solution: Add `/jobs/metrics` endpoint and CLI command with aggregated job + queue telemetry, update documentation, and extend automated coverage.
  - Files touched / to create: Manager API schemas/router/store, CLI jobs module, API & CLI tests, OpenAPI spec, queue migration guide, manager plan, prompt log entry.
  - Follow-up actions requested: Run ruff + pytest to validate changes.
- **Decision**:
  - Accepted (solution aligns with Phase 1.5 observability goals and passes review).
- **Validation**:
  - Tests run: `python -m ruff check backend`, `pytest`.
  - Manual checks: Reviewed schema updates and documentation edits for consistency.
- **Notes / Next Steps**:
  - TODOs: Consider exposing Prometheus/OpenTelemetry hooks in later phases.
  - Risks: Average duration calculation relies on persisted timestamps; ensure worker errors still populate metrics in future enhancements.
