# Codex Prompt Log

- **Date / Time**: 2025-10-17 14:30 (UTC)
- **Feature / Task**: <easy manager stack bootstrap>
- **Context Summary**:
  - Current state / branch: work
  - Key constraints (deps, performance, security): Provide a one-command developer setup for the manager backend without breaking existing manual workflows.
- **Prompt**:
  ```text
  easy setup lazım
  ```
- **Assistant Output Summary**:
  - Proposed solution: Introduce a Python helper that starts Redis, the FastAPI server, and the worker together, and document the single-command workflow in the README.
  - Files touched / to create: scripts/run_manager_stack.py, README.md, docs/prompt_logs/2025-10-17-easy-manager-setup.md
  - Follow-up actions requested: None
- **Decision**:
  - Accepted – matches the request for an easier developer bootstrap path while keeping the manual steps as an alternative.
- **Validation**:
  - Tests run: pytest
  - Manual checks: Reviewed README quick-start instructions render and link correctly.
- **Notes / Next Steps**:
  - TODOs: Consider Windows-native Redis guidance for environments without Docker.
  - Risks: Helper script assumes docker CLI availability when auto-starting Redis; users without Docker must rely on --no-start-redis.
