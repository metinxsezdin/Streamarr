# Codex Prompt Log

- **Date / Time**: 2025-10-17 15:30 (UTC)
- **Feature / Task**: Sprint 1 – job detail enrichment and CLI show command
- **Context Summary**:
  - Current state / branch: work branch with manager API + CLI foundations
  - Key constraints (deps, performance, security): maintain FastAPI/SQLModel stack, keep CLI UX parity, ensure test suite stays green
- **Prompt**:
  ```text
  devam edelim
  ```
- **Assistant Output Summary**:
  - Proposed solution: expose job payload and timestamps in the API schema, add a CLI command to fetch job details, and extend tests/OpenAPI docs accordingly.
  - Files touched / to create: backend manager API schemas/store, manager CLI app, API/CLI tests, OpenAPI document, new prompt log entry.
  - Follow-up actions requested: none.
- **Decision**:
  - Accepted – enhancements align with Sprint 1 goals and improve observability for upcoming UI work.
- **Validation**:
  - Tests run: `python -m ruff check backend`, `pytest`
  - Manual checks: Verified CLI command outputs locally via automated tests.
- **Notes / Next Steps**:
  - TODOs: Consider surfacing additional job telemetry (duration, worker id) in future iterations.
  - Risks: None identified; continue monitoring schema changes for compatibility with downstream clients.
