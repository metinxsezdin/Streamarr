- **Assistant Output Summary**:
  - Proposed solution: Extend job models/store to capture worker identifiers and calculated durations, expose them through API/CLI, and update OpenAPI docs.
  - Files touched / to create: backend/manager_api/models.py, backend/manager_api/schemas.py, backend/manager_api/stores/job_store.py, backend/manager_api/routers/jobs.py, backend/tests/test_manager_api.py, backend/tests/test_manager_cli.py, docs/backend/manager_api_openapi.yaml, docs/prompt_logs/2025-10-17-sprint1-jobs-telemetry.md.
  - Follow-up actions requested: None.
- **Decision**:
  - Accepted – enhances observability for downstream UI consumers.
- **Validation**:
  - Tests run: `python -m ruff check backend`, `pytest`.
  - Manual checks: Reviewed updated OpenAPI schema for new fields.
- **Notes / Next Steps**:
  - TODOs: None.
  - Risks: Existing databases will need migrations to add the worker_id column before deployment.
