# Codex Prompt Log

- **Date / Time**: 2025-10-17 18:30 (UTC)
- **Feature / Task**: Restore Expo lockfile for SDK 54 workspace
- **Context Summary**:
  - Current state / branch: `work`
  - Key constraints (deps, performance, security): Lockfile must be regenerated via `npm install` to capture Expo SDK 54 graph and keep deterministic installs.
- **Prompt**:
  ```text
  son değişikliklere bak.
  ```
- **Assistant Output Summary**:
  - Proposed solution: Regenerate `apps/expo/package-lock.json` with `npm install` and reintroduce it to the repo; run Expo typecheck to verify workspace health.
  - Files touched / to create: `apps/expo/package-lock.json`, `docs/prompt_logs/2025-10-17-expo-lockfile-restore.md`
  - Follow-up actions requested: None.
- **Decision**:
  - Accepted – lockfile restored and documented.
- **Validation**:
  - Tests run: `npm --prefix apps/expo run typecheck`
  - Manual checks: Confirmed lockfile regenerated and tracked by git.
- **Notes / Next Steps**:
  - TODOs: Monitor future Expo dependency upgrades for additional lockfile churn.
  - Risks: Large lockfile diffs may require careful rebases on long-lived branches.
