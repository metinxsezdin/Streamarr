# Codex Prompt Log

- **Date / Time**: 2025-10-17 00:00 (UTC)
- **Feature / Task**: Sprint 1 backend job orchestration
- **Context Summary**:
  - Current state / branch: work branch with manager API scaffolding and persistence
  - Key constraints (deps, performance, security): Maintain SQLite-backed store, keep FastAPI app test-covered, align docs/spec
- **Prompt**:
  ```text
  devam edelim.
  ```
- **Assistant Output Summary**:
  - Proposed solution: Implement job store and endpoints, extend CLI, update OpenAPI doc, add tests
  - Files touched / to create: backend manager API stores/routers/state, CLI commands, tests, OpenAPI spec, prompt log
  - Follow-up actions requested: None
- **Decision**:
  - Accepted â€“ advanced Sprint 1 scope with synchronous job execution flow and CLI support.
- **Validation**:
  - Tests run: pytest
  - Manual checks: Verified OpenAPI spec updates and new CLI commands align with API behaviour.
- **Notes / Next Steps**:
  - TODOs: Replace synchronous completion stub with real background execution once job runner is implemented.
  - Risks: Need to ensure future async execution updates do not break CLI contract or tests.
