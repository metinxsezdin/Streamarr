# Codex Prompt Log

- **Date / Time**: 2025-10-17 15:00 (UTC)
- **Feature / Task**: Phase 3 library & jobs UI enhancements
- **Context Summary**:
  - Current state / branch: `work`
  - Key constraints (deps, performance, security): Maintain FastAPI contract alignment, keep Expo screen performance responsive on mobile, preserve CLI/back-end parity.
- **Prompt**:
  ```text
  phase 3'e başlayalım
  ```
- **Assistant Output Summary**:
  - Proposed solution: Implemented Phase 3 requirements for the Expo manager app, adding filtered/paginated library views, job detail modal with streaming logs, STRM regenerate, and playback testing actions while updating roadmap docs.
  - Files touched / to create: Expo library & jobs tabs, shared hooks/API utilities, Auth provider adjustment, type definitions, manager plan roadmap, prompt log.
  - Follow-up actions requested: None.
- **Decision**:
  - Accepted (implemented Phase 3 UI features and documentation updates).
- **Validation**:
  - Tests run: `npm --prefix apps/expo run typecheck`, `python -m ruff check backend`, `pytest`.
  - Manual checks: Verified Expo UI state flows locally via code review (no runtime available in container).
- **Notes / Next Steps**:
  - TODOs: Evaluate lint tooling setup for Expo workspace (currently prompts for ESLint scaffolding).
  - Risks: WebSocket log streaming gracefully degrades to polling if backend endpoint unavailable; monitor real deployment for connectivity.
