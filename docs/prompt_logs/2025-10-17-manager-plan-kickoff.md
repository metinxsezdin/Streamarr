# Codex Prompt Log

- **Date / Time**: 2025-10-17 10:30 (UTC)
- **Feature / Task**: Manager plan kickoff checklist
- **Context Summary**:
  - Current state / branch: work branch with initial documentation only
  - Key constraints (deps, performance, security): Align with manager plan, no code scaffolding yet, maintain prompt log discipline
- **Prompt**:
  ```text
  manager_plan.md'yi oku ve geliştirmeye başlayalım.
  ```
- **Assistant Output Summary**:
  - Proposed solution: Extend Phase 1 section with actionable sprint checklist and log the interaction.
  - Files touched / to create: docs/manager_plan.md, docs/prompt_logs/2025-10-17-manager-plan-kickoff.md
  - Follow-up actions requested: None yet; future work includes executing the checklist items.
- **Decision**:
  - Accepted / Modified / Rejected (with reason)
    - Accepted: adds immediate tasks to start Phase 1 development.
- **Validation**:
  - Tests run: Not applicable (documentation-only change)
  - Manual checks: Reviewed manager_plan context and ensured checklist aligns with roadmap.
- **Notes / Next Steps**:
  - TODOs: Implement Sprint 1 checklist items, draft ADR-0001 after scaffolding.
  - Risks: Scope creep if checklist expands without prioritization; ensure backend scaffolding stays minimal for first pass.
