# Codex Prompt Log

- **Date / Time**: 2025-10-17 17:10 (UTC)
- **Feature / Task**: Sprint 1 resolver health proxy
- **Context Summary**:
  - Current state / branch: work
  - Key constraints (deps, performance, security): Surface resolver health via manager API without introducing async deps; reuse existing config store and maintain CLI/test parity.
- **Prompt**:
  ```text
  devam edelim.
  ```
- **Assistant Output Summary**:
  - Proposed solution: Add a resolver service helper, expose `/resolver/health` router, extend the CLI with `resolver health`, update OpenAPI, and cover the flow with API/CLI tests.
  - Files touched / to create: Manager API state/dependencies/router/service modules, CLI commands, automated tests, OpenAPI draft, prompt log entry.
  - Follow-up actions requested: None.
- **Decision**:
  - Accepted â€“ implemented resolver health proxy endpoints and CLI command as proposed.
- **Validation**:
  - Tests run: `python -m ruff check backend`; `pytest`
  - Manual checks: Verified stubbed resolver service captures base URL in tests.
- **Notes / Next Steps**:
  - TODOs: Consider streaming resolver status and additional diagnostics in future phases.
  - Risks: Proxy currently trusts resolver JSON shape; tighten schema once resolver contract stabilizes.
