# Codex Prompt Log

- **Date / Time**: 2025-10-17 16:45 (UTC)
- **Feature / Task**: Sprint 1 – job log persistence
- **Context Summary**:
  - Current state / branch: work
  - Key constraints (deps, performance, security): Maintain SQLite-backed stores, FastAPI/CLI parity, update OpenAPI + tests, persist structured job logs.
- **Prompt**:
  ```text
  devam edelim
  ```
- **Assistant Output Summary**:
  - Proposed solution: Add SQLModel job log table, persistence store, API + CLI endpoints to append and list logs, auto-log lifecycle events.
  - Files touched / to create: Manager API models/stores/routers/schemas/state/dependencies, CLI command + tests, OpenAPI spec, new prompt log.
  - Follow-up actions requested: Run ruff + pytest, document session.
- **Decision**:
  - Accepted – aligns with Sprint 1 roadmap for persistent job telemetry.
- **Validation**:
  - Tests run: `python -m ruff check backend`, `pytest`
  - Manual checks: Reviewed API + CLI output expectations and OpenAPI alignment.
- **Notes / Next Steps**:
  - TODOs: Consider WebSocket streaming + pagination for large log histories.
  - Risks: Log volume growth in SQLite; may require retention policy post-MVP.
