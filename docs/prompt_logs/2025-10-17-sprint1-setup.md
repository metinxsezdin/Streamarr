# Codex Prompt Log

- **Date / Time**: 2025-10-17 16:00 (UTC)
- **Feature / Task**: Sprint 1 – Manager API setup endpoint and CLI polish
- **Context Summary**:
  - Current state / branch: work
  - Key constraints (deps, performance, security): Stay within Sprint 1 backend scope, reuse existing synchronous job execution stubs, keep SQLite-backed persistence.
- **Prompt**:
  ```text
  Sprint 1 kapsamında kalınarak mevcut API/CLI yüzeyini parlatma ve eksik alt başlıkları kapatma.
  ```
- **Assistant Output Summary**:
  - Proposed solution: Add a dedicated /setup endpoint with shared sync job helper, expose matching CLI command, and expand OpenAPI/tests.
  - Files touched / to create: manager_api setup router/service updates, CLI command/tests, OpenAPI doc, prompt log.
  - Follow-up actions requested: Run ruff + pytest, prepare PR summary after commit.
- **Decision**:
  - Accepted (aligns with Sprint 1 checklist by completing setup surface and polishing CLI parity).
- **Validation**:
  - Tests run: `python -m ruff check backend`, `pytest`
  - Manual checks: Verified OpenAPI spec updates and CLI/HTTP payloads via tests.
- **Notes / Next Steps**:
  - TODOs: Future sprints should replace synchronous job execution with queued worker implementation.
  - Risks: None noted; setup endpoint currently overwrites config without auth guard (acceptable for dev prototype).
