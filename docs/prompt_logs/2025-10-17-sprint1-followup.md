# Codex Prompt Log

- **Date / Time**: 2025-10-17 12:30 (UTC)
- **Feature / Task**: Sprint 1 backend hardening follow-up
- **Context Summary**:
  - Current state / branch: `work`
  - Key constraints (deps, performance, security): add persistence and tooling without breaking existing FastAPI scaffolding; prefer SQLite + SQLModel for quick durability; keep CLI lightweight.
- **Prompt**:
  ```text
  pushla
  ```
- **Assistant Output Summary**:
  - Proposed solution: introduce SQLModel-backed config store, CLI shim, OpenAPI draft, ADR, and backend Makefile while expanding tests.
  - Files touched / to create: backend manager API modules (state, store, db, models), CLI package, tests, requirements, docs (ADR, OpenAPI, plan checklist, prompt log), backend Makefile.
  - Follow-up actions requested: run pytest and document results.
- **Decision**:
  - Accepted â€“ implemented full Sprint 1 checklist including persistence, CLI, and documentation updates.
- **Validation**:
  - Tests run: `pytest`
  - Manual checks: inspected generated SQLite database path handling and CLI command outputs via automated tests.
- **Notes / Next Steps**:
  - TODOs: extend routers to cover jobs/library/resolver endpoints per OpenAPI plan.
  - Risks: SQLite concurrency limits once background jobs arrive; ensure migration path during Phase 1.5.
