# Codex Prompt Log

- **Date / Time**: 2025-10-17 09:15 (UTC)
- **Feature / Task**: Sprint 1 kickoff backend scaffolding
- **Context Summary**:
  - Current state / branch: `work`
  - Key constraints (deps, performance, security): Start Manager API scaffolding with FastAPI, maintain prompt log requirements.
- **Prompt**:
  ```text
  sprinte başla
  ```
- **Assistant Output Summary**:
  - Proposed solution: Scaffold a new `backend/manager_api` FastAPI service with health and config endpoints, in-memory config store, and tests.
  - Files touched / to create: New FastAPI package, routers, schemas, tests, and prompt log entry.
  - Follow-up actions requested: None.
- **Decision**:
  - Accepted – scaffold implemented per Sprint 1 kickoff scope.
- **Validation**:
  - Tests run: `pytest`
  - Manual checks: Verified default config payload shape via unit tests.
- **Notes / Next Steps**:
  - TODOs:
    - Implement persistence layer (SQLite) and job queue orchestration.
  - Risks:
    - In-memory config store is temporary; multi-process deployments need shared storage.
