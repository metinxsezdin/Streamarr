# Codex Prompt Log

- **Date / Time**: 2025-10-17 16:45 (UTC)
- **Feature / Task**: Phase 2 kickoff â€“ Expo foundation
- **Context Summary**:
  - Current state / branch: work (Phase 1.5 queue + observability merged, Expo app not yet scaffolded)
  - Key constraints (deps, performance, security): align with existing manager API contracts, prefer Expo Router, persist tokens securely without breaking web fallback
- **Prompt**:
  ```text
  phase 2 ile devam edelim
  ```
- **Assistant Output Summary**:
  - Proposed solution: scaffold Expo project with router tabs, onboarding flow, dashboard metrics, and settings wiring to backend endpoints
  - Files touched / to create: apps/expo app source (layouts, screens, providers), Expo configs, manager plan checklist update, new prompt log
  - Follow-up actions requested: run backend lint/tests, install npm deps, capture summary in plan
- **Decision**:
  - Accepted; matches Phase 2 roadmap goals for navigation, setup wizard, session persistence, and basic dashboard/setting surfaces
- **Validation**:
  - Tests run: `python -m ruff check backend`, `pytest`
  - Manual checks: `npm install` in `apps/expo` to generate lockfile (no runtime UI validation in container)
- **Notes / Next Steps**:
  - TODOs: flesh out authentication handshake once backend issues tokens; add React Query mutations for library filters in later phases
  - Risks: Expo dependencies may drift without CI build; need follow-up to add lint/typecheck automation for the new package
