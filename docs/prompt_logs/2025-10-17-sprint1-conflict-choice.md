# Codex Prompt Log

- **Date / Time**: 2025-10-17 14:30 (UTC)
- **Feature / Task**: Clarify manager API conflict resolution
- **Context Summary**:
  - Current state / branch: `work`
  - Key constraints (deps, performance, security): Maintain FastAPI manager stack compatibility and preserve SQLModel-backed stores
- **Prompt**:
  ```text
  which one is true
  ```
- **Assistant Output Summary**:
  - Proposed solution: Align the manager API application factory with the AppState-backed router wiring to avoid future merge ambiguity
  - Files touched / to create: `backend/manager_api/app.py`, `docs/prompt_logs/2025-10-17-sprint1-conflict-choice.md`
  - Follow-up actions requested: Run backend test suite and lint checks
- **Decision**:
  - Accepted / Modified / Rejected (with reason): Accepted â€” reinforces the intended AppState usage path captured in prior sprint work
- **Validation**:
  - Tests run: `pytest`, `python -m ruff check backend`
  - Manual checks: Verified FastAPI application wiring and router registration order
- **Notes / Next Steps**:
  - TODOs: Monitor for additional merge conflicts as upstream evolves
  - Risks: None identified
