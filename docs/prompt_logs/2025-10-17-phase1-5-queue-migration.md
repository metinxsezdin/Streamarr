# Codex Prompt Log

- **Date / Time**: 2025-10-17 14:30 (UTC)
- **Feature / Task**: Phase 1.5 – Queue transition & observability
- **Context Summary**:
  - Current state / branch: feature branch with Sprint 1 backend artifacts
  - Key constraints (deps, performance, security): replace synchronous jobs with Redis-backed RQ while keeping SQLite persistence and CLI parity
- **Prompt**:
  ```text
  faz 1.5i yapalım.
  ```
- **Assistant Output Summary**:
  - Proposed solution: integrate Redis/RQ queue, add worker entrypoint, surface queue health, update CLI/tests/docs, provide migration guide
  - Files touched / to create: manager API services, routers, settings, CLI, tests, docker-compose, documentation, prompt log
  - Follow-up actions requested: run lint/tests, document queue migration, update roadmap progress
- **Decision**:
  - Accepted – implemented Redis-backed queue with fakeredis-powered tests and documentation updates
- **Validation**:
  - Tests run: `python -m ruff check backend`, `pytest`
  - Manual checks: reviewed OpenAPI and manager_plan updates for accuracy
- **Notes / Next Steps**:
  - TODOs: explore real Redis integration in CI, add metrics exporters in future phase
  - Risks: worker process currently executes placeholder job body; pipeline tasks will need to plug into new hook
