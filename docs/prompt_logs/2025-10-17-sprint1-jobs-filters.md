- **Date / Time**: 2025-10-17 15:30 (UTC)
- **Feature / Task**: Sprint 1 â€“ Job filtering enhancements
- **Context Summary**:
  - Current state / branch: work
  - Key constraints (deps, performance, security): maintain SQLite-backed job store and CLI/API parity with existing FastAPI service
- **Prompt**:
  ```text

  ```
- **Assistant Output Summary**:
  - Proposed solution: Add job list filtering support for statuses and job types across API, store, CLI, and OpenAPI docs with tests.
  - Files touched / to create: backend job store/router schemas, CLI command, API & CLI tests, OpenAPI spec, prompt log entry.
  - Follow-up actions requested: Run lint/tests and document the session.
- **Decision**:
  - Accepted (implemented status/type filters with coverage).
- **Validation**:
  - Tests run: `python -m ruff check backend`, `pytest`
  - Manual checks: Reviewed API/CLI parameter handling for repeat flags and case normalization.
- **Notes / Next Steps**:
  - TODOs: Expand job detail responses with payload metadata in a future iteration.
  - Risks: None identified; further pagination/filter combinations will need UI validation later.
