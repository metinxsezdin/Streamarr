# Codex Prompt Log

- **Date / Time**: 2025-10-17 14:30 (UTC)
- **Feature / Task**: Sprint 1 conflict cleanup follow-up
- **Context Summary**:
  - Current state / branch: work
  - Key constraints (deps, performance, security): Resolve outstanding merge blockers; ensure backend tests/lint succeed locally.
- **Prompt**:
  ```text
  still need to resolve
  ```
- **Assistant Output Summary**:
  - Proposed solution: Verify repository state, install missing FastAPI dependencies, rerun backend lint/tests to confirm clean merge readiness, and document the session.
  - Files touched / to create: None (code unchanged); add new prompt log entry documenting verification.
  - Follow-up actions requested: Commit verification updates and prepare PR summary once checks pass.
- **Decision**:
  - Accepted / Modified / Rejected (with reason)
    - Accepted: Dependency installation and verification steps executed as proposed.
- **Validation**:
  - Tests run: `python -m ruff check backend`; `pytest`
  - Manual checks: Verified working tree clean and no merge conflict markers remain.
- **Notes / Next Steps**:
  - TODOs: Monitor upstream merges for new conflicts; proceed with PR once reviewer feedback addressed.
  - Risks: None identified after dependency install and test run.
