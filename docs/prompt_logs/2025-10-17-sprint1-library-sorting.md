# Codex Prompt Log

- **Date / Time**: 2025-10-17 16:30 (UTC)
- **Feature / Task**: Sprint 1 – Library multi-site filters and sorting controls
- **Context Summary**:
  - Current state / branch: work
  - Key constraints (deps, performance, security): Maintain FastAPI/SQLModel patterns, keep CLI/API parity, extend tests and OpenAPI docs.
- **Prompt**:
  ```text
  devam edelim
  ```
- **Assistant Output Summary**:
  - Proposed solution: Add repeatable site filters and configurable sort ordering to library API/store, mirror options in CLI, and update docs/tests.
  - Files touched / to create: backend manager API router/store/schemas, CLI entrypoint, API & CLI tests, OpenAPI spec, new prompt log entry.
  - Follow-up actions requested: Run lint/tests and prepare PR with summary.
- **Decision**:
  - Accepted – extends previously planned library filtering enhancements (multi-site & sorting) with full coverage.
- **Validation**:
  - Tests run: `python -m ruff check backend`, `pytest`
  - Manual checks: Verified JSON ordering expectations in API/CLI test assertions.
- **Notes / Next Steps**:
  - TODOs: Consider adding explicit pagination metadata (total pages) in future sprint.
  - Risks: None – functionality remains read-only with deterministic ordering.
